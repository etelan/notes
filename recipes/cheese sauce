# Cheesy Chip Cheese Sauce

**Ingredients:**
- 1 cup shredded cheddar cheese (you can use a mix of different cheeses if you prefer)
- 1 cup milk
- 2 tablespoons butter
- 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
- 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder (optional)
- Salt and pepper to taste

**Instructions:**
1. In a saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat.
2. Once the butter has melted, add the flour to the pan and whisk continuously for about 1 minute to make a roux. This will help thicken the sauce.
3. Gradually pour in the milk while whisking constantly to avoid lumps.
4. Continue cooking the mixture, stirring frequently, until it starts to thicken and bubble.
5. Reduce the heat to low and add the shredded cheese to the sauce. Stir until the cheese has melted completely and the sauce is smooth.
6. If desired, add garlic powder and season with salt and pepper to taste. Stir well to incorporate the flavors.
7. Remove the saucepan from the heat and let the cheese sauce cool for a few minutes. It will continue to thicken as it cools.
8. Serve the cheese sauce warm over your cheesy chips, and enjoy!

Note: If the cheese sauce becomes too thick, you can thin it out by adding a little more milk and whisking until you reach your desired consistency. Similarly, if it's too thin, you can cook it for a bit longer to thicken it up. Adjust the seasonings according to your taste preferences.
