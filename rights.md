1. No comment
2. No personal details
3. Under what power
4. No duty solicitor
5. No caution

### NO COMMENT
- Not required to answer police questions
- You don't have to say no comment, just don't have to talk to them
- They'll be looking for the organizer
- No such thing as an informal chat with police
- Section 50 anti social behavior - they use it to get your information
- "Am I obliged to respond officer?"
- "Sorry I can't help"

### No Personal Details
- You do not need to give the police any personal details
- If you are arrested that changes
- You do not have to carry ID by law

*Exceptions:*
- Charged with a summons
- In charge of a motor vehicle
- Anyone in a vehicle accident
- Airports and Ports - weird rules

### Under what power?
- When a cop asks you to do something, you ask them Under What Power?
- What they say, write it down, and try get their badge number
- Don't ask if it is S12 or S14 as otherwise you can't plead ignorance ;)

### No Duty Solicitor
- Usually bad advice, they're not a specialist
- On a bustcard, you call the free legal advice at the police station
- It is always free to call your chosen solicitor

### What is a caution
- It is an admission of guilt, don't accept it
- There is no legal fighting if you accept the caution
- Only accept a caution if your solicitor says so, and get them to explain it

*PCSC Act 2022:*
- Restricts your rights if you accept the caution
- Not in force yet
- Basically just makes cautions even worse!

### Bustcards
- Pocket-sized cards with info on your rights and how to contact lawyers and support helplines

### Police Tactics
- They are unpredictable
- PLO - police intelligence gathering
- Evidence Gathering Officer - Filming crowds or individuals
- Kettling - surround people to stop them leaving
- Aggression, Intimidation, and Lying - answer all with no comment
- Splitting up groups - to try and get people to turn on each other
- Stop and Search - [Guide](https://greenandblackcross.org/guides/stop-and-search/)

### Private Security
- Similar to police
- Rougher
- Can be very forceful

### Legal Observer
- They witness monitor and record your actions, by a third party
- Their evidence can be used in your case

### What to bring to an action and what not to
- Leave ID at home
- Bust card
- Some cash
- Cheap burner phone
- No valuables
- No knives or drugs
- Unopened medication

### Good tips
- Use Signal
- ProtonMail
- Don't use words like organizer, leader, arrestable, etc
- Have a codename
- Don't talk about your role on social media
- Smartphone at home - geofencing
- Make sure someone knows you are at the action
